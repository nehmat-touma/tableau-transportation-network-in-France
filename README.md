# tableau-transportation-network-in-France

In this **Data Visualization** project, the aim is to capture patterns in the **transportation data of trains across regions in France** and draw conclusions from them and aim to analyze whether there are relationships between the columns. A total of eight visualizations, some complementary, some individually insightful, including the map of France, are joined in one dashboard. 

The dataset retrieved from Kaggle is entitled “**Public transport traffic data in France**” and includes 7807 rows and 32 columns. It is composed of monthly data from **2015 to 2020**. It is displayed in such a way that each row represents a given path from a departure to an arrival station during a certain month. These stations are located all over France, with a small number in other countries in Europe; including Spain, Italy, Germany and Switzerland.

_The main columns of interest in this project are: Departure and Arrival Stations, Average travel time, Average travel time, Number of cancelled trains, Number of late trains at departure, Average delay of late arriving trains in minutes and Percentages of trains late due to different reasons._
